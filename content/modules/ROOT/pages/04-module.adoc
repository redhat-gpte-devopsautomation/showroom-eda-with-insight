== Explore Red Hat Insights RHEL inventory
[upperalpha]

. Your host *node1.{guid}.internal* is already connected to Red Hat Insights. To connect, We used the *rhc* command (remote host configuration) which wraps the subscription-manager and the insights registration command into a single command while also enabling some other capabilities like Insights remediation.

. To Locate the host in the Red Hat Insights RHEL inventory. Return to Hybrid Cloud Console {hybrid_cloud_url}. Click the search bar at the top *(the magnifying glass)*
+
****
[upperroman]
.Search Inventory
image::hybrid-cloud-rhel-inventory-search.jpg[Inventory]
****

. In the search box, type *Inventory*. You should see several results in the drop down box, select *Inventory | RHEL*
+
****
[upperroman]
.Search Keyworkd
image::hybrid-cloud-rhel-inventory-search-keyword.jpg[Inventory keyword]
****


. In the inventory you should see your host listed as *node1.{guid}.internal*.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can select your host and see basic system facts and analytics if desired.
There are several Advisor (predictive analytics) findings as well as detected vulnerabilities and needed patches.  Feel free to explore the inventory if desired.

== Red Hat Insights Malware Detection

=== Setup Malware Detection
[upperalpha]
. To setup Malware Detection, You need to login into insight host. To login click on right side browser based terminal and run the following commands:
+
IMPORTANT: *node1.{guid}.internal* is running behind a firewall, so direct SSH access is not possible. However, it is accessible through the bastion gateway.
+
[upperroman]
.. First you need to connect with bastion gateway as follows:
+
****
[upperroman]
* *ssh {bastion_ssh_user_name}@bastion.{guid}{subdomain_base_suffix}*
+
NOTE: Enter the *{bastion_ssh_password}* when prompted for password.
****

.. Now run following command from bastion gateway to connect with insight host
+
****
[upperroman]
* *ssh node1.{guid}.internal*
+
NOTE: Key based authentication is configured so we don't need password for the node.
****


. *YARA client:*
[upperroman]
.. *Malware Detection needs the YARA client*: You will evaluate your system for potential malware using the Insights Malware Detection service. Insights leverages YARA to scan and detect malware. In your environment, the YARA client is already installed.

.. *Malware Detection needs YARA configuration*: The configuration file /etc/insights-client/malware-detection-config.yml has already been set up to enable live scans. This configuration is set to scan only the /home directory, significantly improving the scan speed.


. Since this is a new system, there is currently nothing to detect. To simulate a malware detection hit, we will use the *EICAR Anti-Malware* test files. To download the EICAR files into the user's home directory, run the following command:
+
NOTE: More information about eicar is available here if you would like to learn more: https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/[window=_blank]
+
.Go to Home directory
[source,shell]
----
cd $HOME
----
+
.Download EICAR Anti-Malware test files
[source,shell]
----
curl https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com -o /home/lab-user/eicar.com <1>
curl https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt -o /home/lab-user/eicar.com.txt <2>
curl https://secure.eicar.org/eicar_com.zip -o /home/lab-user/eicar_com.zip <3>
curl https://secure.eicar.org/eicarcom2.zip -o /home/lab-user/eicar_com2.zip <4>
----


. Now, list all of the downloaded files, You should see the 4 eicar files in your home directory.
+
[source,shell]
----
ls -l
----

+
.Sample Output
[source,text]
----
total 16
-rw-r--r--. 1 lab-user users  68 Dec 30 06:29 eicar.com
-rw-r--r--. 1 lab-user users 308 Dec 30 06:29 eicar_com2.zip
-rw-r--r--. 1 lab-user users  68 Dec 30 06:29 eicar.com.txt
-rw-r--r--. 1 lab-user users 184 Dec 30 06:29 eicar_com.zip
----

+
NOTE: Each file contains the same text which simulates a malware signature



=== Generate Malware Detection Incident
[upperalpha]

. Lets run the malware detection scan to generate Malware Detection incident in your system. Run the following command.
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo insights-client --collector malware-detection
----


. You should see following similar output:
+
.Sample output of the command
[source,text]
----

----
+
NOTE: That is yara finding the malware signature from eicar in each of the four files. Now you can see malware detected inside of Insights.
+
IMPORTANT: Wait until the command is completely finished running and you are returned to the terminal prompt before continuing to the next step.



=== Verify Malware Detection Triggered
[upperalpha]

. To view Malware Detected in Insights, Return to Hybrid Cloud Console {hybrid_cloud_url}. On the left hand navigation bar go to *Security → Malware → Signatures*

+
[NOTE]
====
Here you should see a big exclamation mark telling you that we have matched a malware signature.
If there were no malware matches you would see a green checkmark. Due to the shared environment with multiple people taking this lab it is unlikely you will see the green checkmark today.

Looking next to the exclamation mark you will see the number of matched signatures as well as the number of enabled and disabled signatures.

Malware detection signatures can be disabled in the event that a false positive is detected, but your user account in this lab does not have the permissions to enable or disable signatures.
====

+
****
.Malware Detected
image::hybrid-cloud-malware-detection.jpg[Malware Detected]
****

. Scroll down the page and you will see the matched signature - *XFTI_EICAR_AV_Test*

. Click on *XFTI_EICAR_AV_Test*. You will see the details of the signature and which systems have matched this malware.

. Locate your system *node1.{guid}.internal*.
+
[NOTE]
====
You should notice that you have the date of the last match and the total number of matches. The total number of matches should be 4 assuming that you only ran the commands as described in the exercise - that is because the eicar package included 4 test files - one match for each of the files.
====
+
****
.Locate node1.{guid}.internal
image::hybrid-cloud-malware-node.jpg[Node]
****

. Click the *arrow* to the left of your system's name to expand the details.
+
[NOTE]
====
Here you can see the details of the match. You can download this as a text file or copy it to your clipboard for the purposes of sending these details to your security team.

If you look through the output you should see 4 different “Match Source” entries - one for each of the eicar files that you put onto the system.
====
+
****
.node1.{guid}.internal Details
image::hybrid-cloud-malware-node-details.jpg[Node]
****

. Since you detected some Malware (even though it is just a test), this should have generated an event. Go to the event log and verify that an event was created: https://console.redhat.com/settings/notifications/eventlog[window=_blank]

. You should see an event type of Detected Malware with the *Integration: Event-Driven Ansible*.



. To verify that we triggered your integration, let's return to the *Ansible Automation Platform* environment.
[upperroman]


.. Go to *Automation Decisions → Rulebook Activations* and Observe - *RH Insights rulebook* Rulebook Activations *Fire Count* has been increasd.
+
****
.Rulebook Activation

****

.. Go to *Automation Execution → Jobs* and Observe: New job *handle-malware-detection* has just run.

.Job Template Run

== Summary

In summary, You have created a connection between the Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 Event-Driven Ansible environment and Insights.
You created a notification behavior group that calls this integration when Malware is detected on a RHEL host.
Upon receiving an event on Malware being detected, Ansible Automation Platform runs a rulebook.

This rulebook doesn't really do much today, but you could create a rulebook that follows the policies and procedures of your organization in the event that malware is detected.

That completes this exercise on integrating Event-Driven Ansible with Red Hat Insights.
