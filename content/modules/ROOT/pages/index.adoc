== Introduction

In this lab we are going to set up a Red Hat Enterprise Linus host to evaluate for Malware using Red Hat Insights, included with your subscriptions for AAP, RHEL, and OpenShift.
We'll configure an integration with EDA so any events generated by Insights will be sent to EDA to trigger rulesbooks, in this case a rulebook for what to do when Malware is detected. 
We will then simulate malware on the box using the eicar test signature which Insights will detect as malware.

We will begin by setting up Ansible Automation Platform.

To save time in the lab environment, most of what you will need is already configured for you.
In the Automation Controller we have Insights credentials, a project, and an inventory.
We will need to sync the inventory.

On the Event Driven Ansible side, we have Insights, a registry.io, and local credentials configured as well as a project, and an event stream.  We'll need the URL from the event stream
