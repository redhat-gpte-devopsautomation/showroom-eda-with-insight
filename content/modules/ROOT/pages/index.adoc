== Event-Driven Ansible

=== The Power of Event-Driven Ansible
Event-Driven Ansible offers an amalgamation of Ansible's versatility and the principles of event-driven architecture, making it a significant asset for any operational ecosystem.

In this workshop, you will discover how Event-Driven Ansible can manage not just application deployments and scaling operations but also be utilized for daily tasks and swift troubleshooting. This platform efficiently transforms automation into a quick, proactive response mechanism across the entire ecosystem, which is tailored for your customer's specific business needs.

By leveraging Event-Driven Ansible, you can significantly enhance your customer's infrastructure recovery time. Whenever an issue arises, the system automatically triggers a predefined response, reducing the time spent manually diagnosing and resolving the problem. This automation not only speeds up recovery but also minimizes the risk of human error during the troubleshooting process.

Additionally, Event-Driven Ansible also helps streamline and automate routine tasks. This allows your customer to focus on strategic initiatives rather than getting bogged down in day-to-day operations. Tasks like system updates, user management, and routine maintenance can be automated, saving valuable time and resources.

During the workshop, you'll provide a clear understanding of how Event-Driven Ansible helps achieve efficient, intelligent, and responsive automation. This not only helps in rapid issue resolution and infrastructure recovery but also in efficiently managing daily operations. By showcasing these capabilities, you can highlight the extensive benefits and potential applications of Event-Driven Ansible in their organization, thereby enhancing their operational efficiency and productivity.


=== Understanding Rulebooks

==== The Backbone of Event Driven Ansible
Central to our demonstration today are *'Rulebooks.'* In the context of Event-Driven Ansible, a rulebook defines the guidelines that Ansible should follow in response to particular events or conditions. 

A rulebook is our strategic playbook, constituted of three fundamental components:

* *Sources:* The starting point of our automation journey, sources determine the event source we're utilizing. These are drawn from a plethora of source plugins, crafted to cater to a variety of use cases. As we continue to expand our portfolio, more sources will become available. As of now, we have several ready-to-use plugins, including webhooks, Kafka, Azure service bus, file changes, and alertmanager.

* *Rules:* Acting as the decision makers, rules set the conditions we're looking for within the chosen event source. If a condition is met, it can trigger a subsequent action, forming a critical link in our automation chain.

* *Actions:* The culmination of our process, actions decide what should transpire once a condition is fulfilled. A variety of actions are currently available, such as run_playbook, run_module, set_fact, post_event, and debug.

This rulebook, therefore, provides a comprehensive, customizable, and extensible blueprint for your automation processes, ensuring we cover the full spectrum from event sources to reactive actions.

==== The Business Benefits of Event-Driven Ansible
In the course of this demo, we will delve into the manifold business benefits you can achieve by implementing Event-Driven Ansible:

*Real-Time Responsiveness:* Automate responses to events, leading to quicker issue resolution and optimized resource utilization.

* *Increased Efficiency:* Reduce manual tasks, minimize errors, and bolster operational productivity.

* *Scalability and Flexibility:* Expand your automation capabilities in sync with your infrastructure, enabling a seamless adaptation to changing environments.

* *Intelligent Automation:* Utilize event data to make informed decisions, thereby optimizing resource usage.

* *Enhanced Reliability:* Ensure consistent and accurate task execution, thus reducing risks associated with human error.

* *Improved Compliance and Governance:* Enforce standards, track automated actions, and demonstrate compliance.

* *Rapid Innovation and Time-to-Market:* Accelerate service delivery and application deployment to respond more swiftly to market trends.

Integration with Existing Systems: Seamlessly integrate with your existing tools, systems, and APIs.

=== Conclusion: The Transformative Potential of Event-Driven Ansible

In this demonstration, you will see how Event-Driven Ansible serves as a catalyst, unlocking unprecedented levels of automation that boost efficiency, scalability, and reliability across any operational environment. So, gear up for a deep dive into the next generation of automation technology.

== Lab Introduction
This workshop covers two key scopes: Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Insights, focusing on their integration and how they work together to enhance automation and security within the environment.

=== Red Hat OpenShift Events and Event-Driven Ansible

In this workshop, we're showcasing the adaptability and effectiveness of Event-Driven Ansible. While we are utilizing Red Hat OpenShift events as a trigger, remember to highlight that this tool's capabilities aren't limited to just OpenShift - it's designed to work effectively with any operational ecosystem your customer may have.

Showcase how Event-Driven Ansible can use events to initiate actions, demonstrating its ability to turn any event into an opportunity for intelligent automation. This isn't just automation; it's an efficient, event-driven response system that's compatible with any operational ecosystem.

Use real-world examples to illustrate how this tool can enhance their processes, making them more efficient, faster, and responsive. By the end of this demonstration, your customers should understand the competitive advantage and agility that adopting Event-Driven Ansible can bring to their operations in today's rapidly evolving digital landscape.


=== Evaluating Malware Detection with Red Hat Insights and Event-Driven Ansible
In this workshop, you will learn how to configure a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) host to evaluate for malware using Red Hat Insights, a powerful tool included with your subscriptions for Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) and RHEL.

You will also integrate Insights with Event-Driven Ansible to respond automatically to malware detections. Specifically, you’ll configure an automation workflow where events generated by Insights trigger rulebooks in Event-Driven Ansible. For this workshop, we’ll use a rulebook designed to handle malware detection events.

To test the workflow, you’ll simulate malware detection using the EICAR test signature, which is recognized as malware by Insights.

// === Lab Environment Setup

// To save time, most of the required configuration has been pre-provisioned in the lab environment. Here's a breakdown of what is ready for you and the steps you'll need to complete:

// . Ansible Automation Platform Configuration
// +
// * The Automation Controller already has:
// ** Insights credentials
// ** A project
// ** An inventory
// * Action required:
// ** Sync the inventory to ensure it reflects the latest configuration.

// . Event-Driven Ansible Configuration
// +
// * Preconfigured elements include:
// ** Insights credentials
// ** Registry.io credentials
// ** Local credentials
// ** A project
// ** An event stream
// * Action required:
// ** Obtain the URL for the event stream from the Event-Driven Ansible interface. This URL will be used to link Insights with Event-Driven Ansible.

// == Next Steps
// . Set Up Ansible Automation Platform:
// * Log in to Automation Controller and sync the inventory.

// . Integrate Event Stream:
// * Log in to Event-Driven Ansible.
// * Obtain the Event Stream URL from the preconfigured event stream.

// . Create Rulebook Activation:
// * Use the Event Stream URL to create a rulebook activation in Event-Driven Ansible.
// * Select the preloaded project and the malware detection rulebook for the activation.

// . Simulate Malware Detection:
// * Simulate malware on the RHEL host using the EICAR test signature.
// * Observe how Insights detects the malware and generates an event.

// . Verify Automation Workflow:
// * Confirm that the event triggers the rulebook activation, executing the predefined actions to handle malware detection.

// By the end of this lab, you’ll have a fully functional automation workflow that detects and responds to malware using Red Hat Insights and Event-Driven Ansible.
