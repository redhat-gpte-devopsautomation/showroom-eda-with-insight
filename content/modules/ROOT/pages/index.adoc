== Lab Introduction
=== Evaluating Malware Detection with Red Hat Insights and Event-Driven Ansible
In this lab, you will learn how to configure a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) host to evaluate for malware using Red Hat Insights, a powerful tool included with your subscriptions for Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) and RHEL.

You will also integrate Insights with Event-Driven Ansible to respond automatically to malware detections. Specifically, you’ll configure an automation workflow where events generated by Insights trigger rulebooks in Event-Driven Ansible. For this lab, we’ll use a rulebook designed to handle malware detection events.

To test the workflow, you’ll simulate malware detection using the EICAR test signature, which is recognized as malware by Insights.

=== Lab Environment Setup

To save time, most of the required configuration has been pre-provisioned in the lab environment. Here's a breakdown of what is ready for you and the steps you'll need to complete:

. Ansible Automation Platform Configuration
+
* The Automation Controller already has:
** Insights credentials
** A project
** An inventory
* Action required:
** Sync the inventory to ensure it reflects the latest configuration.

. Event-Driven Ansible Configuration
+
* Preconfigured elements include:
** Insights credentials
** Registry.io credentials
** Local credentials
** A project
** An event stream
* Action required:
** Obtain the URL for the event stream from the Event-Driven Ansible interface. This URL will be used to link Insights with Event-Driven Ansible.

== Next Steps
. Set Up Ansible Automation Platform:
* Log in to Automation Controller and sync the inventory.

. Integrate Event Stream:
* Log in to Event-Driven Ansible.
* Obtain the Event Stream URL from the preconfigured event stream.

. Create Rulebook Activation:
* Use the Event Stream URL to create a rulebook activation in Event-Driven Ansible.
* Select the preloaded project and the malware detection rulebook for the activation.

. Simulate Malware Detection:
* Simulate malware on the RHEL host using the EICAR test signature.
* Observe how Insights detects the malware and generates an event.

. Verify Automation Workflow:
* Confirm that the event triggers the rulebook activation, executing the predefined actions to handle malware detection.

By the end of this lab, you’ll have a fully functional automation workflow that detects and responds to malware using Red Hat Insights and Event-Driven Ansible.
