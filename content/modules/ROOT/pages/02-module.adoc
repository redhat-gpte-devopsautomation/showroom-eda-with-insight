= Trigger Red Hat OpenShift Events

== Namespace Event to Set Resource Quota

In order to trigger a set resource quota on a new namespace (rocketchat) by Event-driven ansible event. The new namespace creation will eventually trigger a set resource quota event. As an action for the event it will set resource quota on created rocketchat namespace.

. You need to retrune VS Code Server and open integrated terminal.

. Change current directory test-events directory. This directory contains three yaml files which contain OpenShift object definition. Run *oc* command to create  namespace (rocketchat) which will eventually trigger the event.

== PVC Event to Create Volume Snapshot 

In order to trigger a create volume snapshot of newly added pvc by Event-driven ansible event. We go to the terminal and make sure we are still in the test-events directory which contains three yaml files of OpenShift object definition.

* *To trigger the create volume snapshot* - We run oc command with 2-test-volume-snapshot.yml file which creates rocketchat app, database and persistent volume claim in rocketchat namespace. New persistent volume claim creation will eventually trigger a create volume snapshot event. As an action for the event it will create a snapshot of the persistentvolumeclaim in the rocketchat namespace.

* *To observe and Verify* - We can check Automation Decision (Event-Driven Ansible) Rulebook Activate and Automation Execution (Automation Controller) jobs. To verify the changes run OpenShift oc command to get the volume snapshot list in rocketchat namespace.

. Return to the VS Code Server integrated terminal, Change the directory and run *oc* command to create  the rocketchat application in the rocketchat namespace which will eventually trigger the event.

. Observe Automation Decision (Event-Driven Ansible) Create Volume Snapshot Rulebook Activation has caught the event for new persistentvolumeclaim which triggered the action.

. Observe the Automation Execution (Automation Controller) has a new job running.

. Observe that the new persistentvolumeclaim has a screenshot  in rocketchat namespace.  Run the following command on the second terminal.

== Route Event to Patch Route

In order to trigger a patch route of newly added route by Event-driven ansible event. We go to the terminal and make sure we are still in the test-events directory which contains three yaml files of OpenShift object definition.

* *To trigger the patch route* - We run oc command with 3-test-route-with-cert.yml file which creates route for rocketchat app in rocketchat namespace. New route creation will eventually trigger a patch route event. As an action for the event it will patch the route with a signed certificate in the rocketchat namespace.

* *To observe and Verify* - We can check Automation Decision (Event-Driven Ansible) and Automation Execution (Automation Controller) jobs. To verify the changes run OpenShift oc command to get the route in rocketchat namespace.
